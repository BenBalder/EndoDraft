## üì¶ Download

> **‚û°Ô∏è [Download the latest version from the Releases tab](https://github.com/BenBalder/EndoDraft/releases)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Windows SmartScreen & Antivirus Notice**<br>

Since the software does not yet have a digital signature (it costs a lot!), some operating systems (especially Windows) may display a **warning** when launching the .exe file, such as:
‚ÄúWindows protected your PC‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnknown publisher‚Äù.

This is a standard behavior for unsigned applications and does not mean the file is dangerous.<br>
**EndoDraft** has been thoroughly tested and is **totally safe to use**, so you can ignore the warning.

**‚úÖ If this happens, to proceed on Windows:**

- Click **‚ÄúMore info‚Äù**
- Then select **‚ÄúRun anyway‚Äù**

No installation required. The program runs as a standalone `.exe`.
